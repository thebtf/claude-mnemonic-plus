# Using Engram

## Overview

Engram is persistent shared memory for Claude Code. Hooks automatically capture observations from your coding sessions. Your job is to **use** that knowledge — search it, build on it, and keep it clean.

**Core principle:** Hooks handle input. You handle output. The 40 MCP tools exist so you can retrieve, connect, and maintain the knowledge that hooks collect.

## What Hooks Do Automatically

| Hook | Fires When | Captures |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **SessionStart** | Conversation begins | Injects relevant project memories into context |
| **UserPromptSubmit** | User sends a message | Searches for relevant memories and injects them as `<relevant-memory>` context |
| **PostToolUse** | Any tool completes | Captures tool usage patterns and outcomes |
| **SubagentStop** | Subagent finishes | Notifies system of subagent completion, triggers observation processing |
| **Stop** | Session ends | Generates session summary, stores key observations |

You do NOT need to manually save observations — hooks handle that. Focus on retrieval and curation.

## When to Use Engram Tools

```
Session starts → context already injected (automatic)
  │
  ├─ Need past decisions?     → search / decisions
  ├─ Need recent context?     → get_recent_context / timeline
  ├─ Working on a file?       → find_by_file
  ├─ Exploring a concept?     → find_by_concept / how_it_works
  ├─ Found duplicate memories? → suggest_consolidations / merge
  ├─ Memory quality declining? → get_data_quality_report / trigger_maintenance
  └─ Session ending?          → (automatic via Stop hook)
```

## Top 10 Tools (90% of Value)

### 1. `search` — Hybrid semantic + full-text search

The primary retrieval tool. Combines vector similarity, full-text search, and BM25 scoring.

```
Use: "What do we know about authentication in this project?"
Tool: search(query="authentication implementation decisions")
```

### 2. `decisions` — Find architecture and design decisions

Filters for decision-type observations. Use before making architectural choices.

```
Use: "What was decided about the caching strategy?"
Tool: decisions(query="caching strategy")
```

### 3. `timeline` — Browse observations anchored in time

Navigate observations around a specific point or filter by project, type, and concepts.

```
Use: "What happened recently in this project?"
Tool: timeline(query="recent changes", project="my-project")
```

### 4. `find_by_file` — Observations related to a specific file

Before modifying a file, check what's known about it.

```
Use: "What's been noted about server.go?"
Tool: find_by_file(files="internal/mcp/server.go")
```

### 5. `find_by_concept` — Search by concept tags

Observations are auto-tagged with concepts. Search by tag for focused results.

```
Use: "Everything related to 'vector-search'"
Tool: find_by_concept(concepts="vector-search")
```

### 6. `how_it_works` — System understanding queries

Retrieves explanatory observations about how systems work.

```
Use: "How does the consolidation scheduler work?"
Tool: how_it_works(query="consolidation scheduler")
```

### 7. `find_related_observations` — Relation-based retrieval

Follow knowledge graph relations (causes, fixes, explains, contradicts).

```
Use: "What's connected to this bug fix?"
Tool: find_related_observations(id=42)
```

For deeper graph traversal with configurable depth, use `get_observation_relationships(id=42, max_depth=2)`.

### 8. `get_recent_context` — Latest project observations

Quick dump of the most recent observations for a project.

```
Use: "Catch me up on what happened recently"
Tool: get_recent_context(project="my-project", limit=20)
```

### 9. `get_patterns` — Detected recurring patterns

Surfaces patterns the system has identified across observations.

```
Use: "Are there recurring issues or patterns?"
Tool: get_patterns(project="my-project")
```

### 10. `search_sessions` — Full-text search across session logs

Search through indexed Claude Code session transcripts.

```
Use: "When did we discuss the migration plan?"
Tool: search_sessions(query="migration plan", limit=5)
```

## Workflow by Phase

### Starting Work

1. Context is auto-injected by SessionStart hook
2. If you need more: `search` or `get_recent_context`
3. Before architectural decisions: `decisions` to check prior choices

### During Active Coding

- Before modifying unfamiliar code: `find_by_file` + `how_it_works`
- When encountering a concept: `find_by_concept`
- When debugging: `find_related_observations` to trace cause chains
- When stuck: `search` with different query angles

### Maintaining Memory Quality

Use these periodically or when memory feels noisy:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `suggest_consolidations` | Find observations that should be merged |
| `merge_observations` | Combine duplicates into one |
| `bulk_mark_superseded` | Mark outdated observations |
| `get_data_quality_report` | Overall quality metrics |
| `trigger_maintenance` | Run cleanup tasks |
| `run_consolidation` | Trigger full consolidation cycle (decay + associations) |

### Analytics (When Needed)

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `get_memory_stats` | System overview: counts, storage, health |
| `get_temporal_trends` | Activity patterns over time |
| `analyze_observation_importance` | Which observations matter most |
| `check_system_health` | Is the system performing well |

## Other Tools (Quick Reference)

These tools cover specialized use cases beyond the top 10:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `changes` | Find code modification observations |
| `find_by_type` | Filter by observation type (decision, bugfix, feature, etc.) |
| `find_similar_observations` | Pure vector similarity search |
| `get_context_timeline` | Context organized by time periods |
| `get_timeline_by_query` | Query-filtered timeline view |
| `get_observation` | Fetch a single observation by ID |
| `edit_observation` | Modify observation fields |
| `tag_observation` | Add/remove concept tags |
| `get_observations_by_tag` | List observations with a specific tag |
| `get_observation_quality` | Quality score for one observation |
| `get_observation_relationships` | Graph traversal with configurable depth |
| `get_observation_scoring_breakdown` | Debug scoring formula |
| `batch_tag_by_pattern` | Auto-tag observations matching a pattern |
| `bulk_delete_observations` | Batch delete |
| `bulk_boost_observations` | Boost importance scores in bulk |
| `explain_search_ranking` | Debug why search ranked results a certain way |
| `analyze_search_patterns` | Search usage analytics |
| `export_observations` | Export observations as JSON |
| `get_maintenance_stats` | Maintenance cycle statistics |
| `list_sessions` | List indexed sessions with filtering |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Manually saving observations that hooks would capture | Trust the hooks — they capture tool use, prompts, and session summaries |
| Ignoring injected context | Read `<engram-context>` (session start) and `<relevant-memory>` (per prompt) blocks — they contain prior knowledge |
| Not searching before re-exploring code | `search` first — someone (maybe past you) already documented it |
| Never running maintenance | Periodically use `trigger_maintenance` or `run_consolidation` |
| Using only `search` for everything | Use specialized tools: `decisions` for architecture, `find_by_file` for code, `timeline` for history |
